# Repetition-in-songs
In this project we will attempt to test Donald Knuth notion in his journal called "The Complexity of Songs" that there is a  tendency of popular songs to devolve from long and content-rich ballads to highly repetitive texts. 

You can follow along in my tutorial where I analyse the song called Perfect By Ed sheeran using basic python codes

Here is the version of the lyrics I will be using (which I have cleaned out in order to get a conclusive answer)

 # Perfect  - Ed Sheeran
 
 "I found a love for me darling just dive right in and follow my lead
 well I found a girl beautiful and sweet I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
 because we were just kids when we fell in love not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time
 but darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own and in your eyes you are holding mine
 baby, I am dancing in the dark with you between my arms barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
 when you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath but you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
 well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know she shares my dreams, I hope that someday I will share her home
 I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets to carry love, to carry children of our own
 we are still kids, but we are so in love fighting against all odds I know we will be alright this time
 darling, just hold my hand be my girl, I will be your man I see my future in your eyes
 baby, I am dancing in the dark, with you between my arms barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
 when I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
 baby, I am dancing in the dark, with you between my arms barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
 I have faith in what I see now I know I have met an angel in person and she looks perfect I don't deserve this
 you look perfect tonight"
